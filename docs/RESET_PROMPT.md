# RESET (when the assistant goes off-rails)

Re-read `SESSION_BOOTSTRAP_GLOBAL.md` and `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, then:

1) **Restate constraints + Definition of Done** from PROJECT_CONTEXT
2) **Propose a minimal diff** that fixes only the current issue
3) **List verification commands** to confirm the fix

**No rewrites.** Only fix what's broken.
