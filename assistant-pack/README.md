# assistant-pack

This folder contains the reusable prompt toolkit used to keep Cursor/LLM work consistent across new chats.

Files:
- `SESSION_BOOTSTRAP_GLOBAL.md` — stable global working rules + response contract
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md` — project-specific context template (copy into each project)
- `INIT_SESSION.md` — forces planning + minimal first patch before coding
- `RESET_PROMPT.md` — forces minimal diff + verification when quality drops
- `README_Carefully.md` — detailed usage guide
